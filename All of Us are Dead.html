                It was a normal day. 
                A bit cloudy, but what could you expect from Korea? 
                It all started from when I was at work. 
                Busy day I must say, getting calls from left and right <em>just</em> when my accountant was on holiday. 
                One of my most anno-... I mean ambitious co-workers, Ho-sang, was nagging me about colosing a finance in the start of the fiscal year. 
                After justifying the matter with a hard <strong>no</strong>, I went on to the more important matters at hand.
            <br />

            <br />
                On-jo, my daugther. Her birthday passed a day ago and I wanted to get her an awesome gift. 
                But what would I get her?
                I asked my coworker before he left and he recomemned a tv remote.
                Why did I think it was a good idea at  the time? No Idea. And apparently, I had already bought one for her the year before.
                As I arrived home, my mother, Hu-san, was wating for me at the door. 
                She began telling about On-jo biggest birthday wish, to see her mother again; and no we are not together anymore.  
                I brushed her off, and as I went to her bedroom, I saw On-jo on a calll with her mother, speaking as low as possible as if she did not want mo to hear her on a call with her mom. 
                I entered the room as she quietly told her mom goodbye, that I was here to talk to her. 
            <br />

            <br />
                With the sweetest but a little bit sacaratic simle on her face, she asked me. 
                "Ba-ba, why can't I go to see mother?"
                I said, "You know I have work. But enough of this, I have a gi- "
                "I can go by myself, just drop me off at the train station."
                "Honey, I love you, but you cannot go to Busan right now. I know you want to see her, but it is not a good time right now."
                "When will be a good time?"
                I paused. 
                "...Lets just forget about this, here open your present. :)"
            <br />

            <br />
                As she opens it, I see the defeat on her face, though she tries to hide it as she says.
                "Thanks ba-ba, but you already got this for me twice."
                *Apparently I got it for her twice*
                But as any good parent would want to see their child happy, I sighed and said. 
                "Pack your things, I am taking you to see your mom."
                She was so exicted that she gave me a tight hug and went to go call her mom.
            <br />

            <br /> 
                I exited the room, my mother told me she was proud of me for making such a big decision. 
                I scuffed, saying that it was the only way to make her happy, and I did not want to lose the bond I had with my only daugter.
                That night, I questioned the decisision I made. Was I doing the right thing? 
                Oh well, there is no turning back now, tommmorow is a new day, and we are on our way, to the Train to Busan.

                On-jo and I were in the car, she was looking out the window, barely talking to me, when suddenly, white dust-like particles began to fall.
                As she caught one in her lap, police, firearms, and firefighter trucks began speeding through, head to what seem slike a drastic event. 
                But not to worry, we'll be fine....right?
                As we were running to the train, numerous people were bombarding the doors over what seemed like from afar a video star.
                We got on the train, and we found our seats, On-jo sat by the window, I sat by the isle.
                The train took off, I did not notice that people outside were ruuning away from...something.
